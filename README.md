## Time Series Analyses in Astrophysics Workshop

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the SaMBa Times workshop, a collaborative initiative between SÃ£o Paulo and Bavaria aiming to advance the understanding and application of time series analyses in the field of astrophysics. This unique workshop brings together experts, researchers, and students from two of the most renowned regions in the field to share knowledge, develop skills, and contribute to the cutting-edge of astrophysical research.
About the Workshop

SaMBa Times is designed to foster international collaboration and exchange of ideas between astrophysicists from SÃ£o Paulo and Bavaria. The workshop focuses on practical sessions, theoretical lectures, and hands-on projects on time series analyses, including but not limited to:

    Introduction to time series data in astrophysics
    Techniques for analyzing periodic and non-periodic signals
    Advanced methods for time series analyses, including Fourier analysis, wavelet transforms, and machine learning applications
    Case studies and applications in astrophysical phenomena such as variable stars, exoplanet transits, and active galactic nuclei

## Repository Structure

This repository serves as a central hub for all materials related to the SaMBa Times workshop, including:
